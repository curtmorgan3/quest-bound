Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
12.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16(b), you and the Company agree that every dispute arising in connection with this User Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this User Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this User Agreement.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

12.2 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in this User Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

12.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and the Company will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (collectively, “AAA Rules”), as modified by this User Agreement. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

12.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Company’s address for Notice is: 6501 Third Avenue NW, Apt. 402, Seattle, WA 98117​. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.

12.5 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with this User Agreement, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

12.6 No Class Actions. EACH USER AGREES THAT USERS MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

12.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If the Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to the Company’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account with the Game Tools or other QUEST BOUND Services will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

12.8 Enforceability. If Section 12.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to this User Agreement.

13 Termination of User Agreement and of Use. Each user agrees that Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate or suspend this Agreement, and/or to terminate or suspend the user’s access or use of any Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, the Site, or any other Company IP Asset for any reason or no reason (including, without limitation, due to a breach of this User Agreement by such User) without notice or liability to you.

Company reserves the right to make these Changes by giving a notice that the Company deems reasonable, both in form and where such notice will be posted or sent, provided, however, the Company reserves the right not to give notice of such Changes to each individual user. A USER’S CONTINUED USE OF THE GAME TOOLS, ANY QUEST BOUND SERVICES, OR THIS SITE AFTER THE EFFECT DATE OF ANY SUCH CHANGE SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES.

15.2 Applicable Law; Disputes.

15.2.1 This User Agreement, and any and all disputes, issues, controversies or matters arising from or related to this Agreement, any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, is governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the laws and decisions of the State of Washington, without giving effect to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions. 15.2.2 Subject at all times to the application of, and the terms and conditions set forth in, Section 12 above ( Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) which shall govern all disputes between the parties, you agree that the state and federal courts sitting in Seattle, Washington will be the exclusive forum and situs for the resolution of any and all disputes, issues, controversies or matters (to the extent such disputes, issues, controversies or matters are not, or are no longer, subject to and governed by Section 12 herein) arising from or related to this User Agreement or any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, and that any such disputes, issues, controversies or matters must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in Seattle, Washington and service of process by certified mail.

15.3 Entire Agreement. This User Agreement, accepted by your first use of the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, and further affirmed by creating an Account or submitting Content to any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, contains the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the subject matter of this User Agreement (including without limitation the use of all Game Tools, all other QUEST BOUND Services, and the Site) and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to that subject matter.
